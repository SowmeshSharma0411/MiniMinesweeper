Minesweeper game created in C as the final project for the C course.
The menu provides 3 optns :
---> Play the game : Choose between Lvl 1,2,3 and any custom game [M*N grid]. We will be needed to enter a x and y value which then will uncover that grid location. If you hit a bomb, You Are OUT!
---> Show leaderboard : A txt file, which gets written into (score being the time taken to clear the board) and read from : to display the leaderboard.
---> Learn how to play the game : redirects you to a pdf version of the Minesweeper game rules and instructions.
